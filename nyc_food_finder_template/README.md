# Practical Applications in Machine Learning Final Project Template

# Cornell Tech Restaurant Finder

This final project proposal template provides an example of product recommendation application for Cornell Tech Shoe Boutique, a family friendly online shoe store. 

The layout has tabs (instead of sidebar). The tabs include 
- Cornell Tech Show Boutique (Home page):
- Women's Shoes, Men's Shoes: Shop for women's shoes, select a recommendation system that's right for you which updates the results (result updates not fully implemented)
- Recommendation Analysis: Shoes classification performance on dummy data including precision, recall, TP, TN, FP, and FN

Run the application:
```
streamlit run nyc_restaurants.py
```

Happy Shopping!
