# Practical Applications in Machine Learning Final Project Template

# Predicting Product Review Sentiment Using Classification

The goal of this template is to build a classification machine learning (ML) pipeline in a web application to use as a tool to analyze the models to gain useful insights about model performance. Using trained classification models, build a ML application that predicts whether a product review is positive or negative.

The template does the following:
* Build end-to-end regression pipeline using 1) multiple regression, 2) polynomial regression, and 3) ridge, and 4) lasso regression.
* Evaluate regression methods using standard metrics including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).
* Develop a web application that walks users through steps of the regression pipeline and provide tools to analyze multiple methods across multiple metrics. 
* Develop a web application that offers a service to customers by predicting housing prices using regression models. 

Run the application:
```
streamlit run final_project.py
